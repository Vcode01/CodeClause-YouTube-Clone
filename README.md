# YouTube Clone
This is a YouTube clone built using React, Tailwind CSS, and an API. The project aims to recreate the core functionality of YouTube, allowing users to search for videos, view video thumbnails and details, and watch videos.

# Features
> The YouTube clone offers the following features:
>Search for videos: Users can enter keywords or phrases in the search bar to find videos matching their search query.
>Display video thumbnails and details: The clone fetches data from the YouTube API and presents users with a visually appealing interface that showcases video thumbnails along with relevant details such as the video title, channel name, and view count.
>Watch videos: Users can select a video from the search results and watch it within the YouTube clone. The video player provides basic controls such as play, pause, seek, and volume control.

# Prerequisites
>Before running the YouTube clone, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

>Node.js (version 12 or above): Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser.
npm (version 6 or above): npm is the package manager for Node.js and is used to install project dependencies.
# Getting Started
>To set up and run the YouTube clone on your local machine, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository: Begin by cloning the YouTube clone repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-clone.git
Navigate to the project directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the cloned project's directory:

cd youtube-clone
# Install dependencies: Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

# Obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key: In order to fetch video data from the YouTube API, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain one:

> Visit the Google Cloud Platform Console at https://console.developers.google.com/.
> Create a new project (if you haven't already).
> Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project.
> Generate an API key for the YouTube Data API v3.
> Configure the API key: Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with the API key you obtained in the previous step:

REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
>Start the development server: Launch the development server by executing the following command:

npm start
# Access the application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the YouTube clone.
